
Protocol:
    The pi communicates to the 8x8 LED matrix via SPI.
There are four bytes sent, which are in, in order: red, green, blue, and row select
Whenever there's a 0 in the nth bit of a color-toggling byte, the nth LED's color is on
Since it's dealing with LEDs, whenever there's a 0 it's on and a 1 means off

RED | BLUE | GREEN | ROW
