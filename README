
Protocol:
    The pi communicates to the 8x8 LED matrix via SPI.
There are four bytes sent, which are in, in order: red, green, blue, and row select
Whenever there's a 0 in the nth bit of a color-toggling byte, the nth LED's color is on <- very good place for a diagram
Note: with LEDs, 0 is "on" and 1 is "off."

RED | BLUE | GREEN | ROW
